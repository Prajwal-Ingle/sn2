### For Developers:

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Application:**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Integrate IoT Devices:**
   ```typescript
   import { DriverBehaviorAnalyzer } from '@/lib/ai/driver-behavior-analyzer'
   import { AccidentPredictor } from '@/lib/ai/accident-predictor'
   import { alertSystem } from '@/lib/ai/real-time-alert-system'

   // Create instances
   const analyzer = new DriverBehaviorAnalyzer()
   const predictor = new AccidentPredictor()

   // Process data from OBD/IoT
   const analysis = analyzer.analyzeBehavior(telemetryArray)
   const prediction = predictor.predictAccidentRisk(current, recent, events)

   // Send alerts
   alertSystem.processAccidentPrediction(prediction, location)
   ```

4. **Connect to Database (when ready):**
   ```typescript
   import { dbService } from '@/lib/db/supabase-client'

   // Insert telemetry
   await dbService.insertTelemetry(telemetryData)

   // Subscribe to real-time updates
   dbService.subscribeToAlerts(customerId, (alert) => {
     // Handle new alert
   })
   ```

## 🔄 What Needs Database to Activate

The following features are **ready but inactive** until database is connected:

1. **Persistent Data Storage**
   - Historical telemetry data
   - Event logs
   - Trip history
   - Safety reports archive

2. **Simulated Data Only:** Not connected to real vehicles (simulator works perfectly)
3. **No User Authentication:** Using mock auth (full auth system exists)
4. **No Map Visualization:** GPS data collected but not displayed on maps yet
5. **Static Risk Zones:** Only 3 pre-configured zones (can add more easily)
